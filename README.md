**Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard with Power BI**

**Description:**
This project showcases an interactive dashboard built using Power BI that provides in-depth insights into bank loan data. The dataset used in this project consists of two Excel files, Finance_1.xlsx, and Finance_2.xlsx, which were obtained from the data.gov platform. The data underwent a rigorous cleaning process, including handling data type conversions, resolving errors, eliminating null values, and other necessary data cleaning procedures. Afterward, the cleaned data was uploaded to Power BI Desktop to create a comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard.

**Dashboard Features:**

1. **Total Customers:** This KPI showcases the total number of customers in the bank's loan portfolio, enabling quick assessment of customer volume.

2. **Total Revolving Balance:** This metric displays the total revolving balance across all loans, helping to understand the bank's exposure to revolving credit.

3. **Total Loan Amount:** This KPI illustrates the cumulative loan amount disbursed by the bank, providing an overview of the bank's lending activities.

4. **Home Ownership Payment Pattern:** The dashboard includes an interactive visualization that explores the payment patterns of different home ownership categories, enabling an analysis of loan repayment trends.

5. **Loan by Years:** Users can slice and analyze loan data based on different years, allowing them to observe loan trends over time.

6. **Interest Rate over Years:** This interactive graph allows users to investigate how interest rates have changed over the years, aiding in the understanding of lending policies and market dynamics.

7. **Total Payment:** This KPI summarizes the total payments made by customers, facilitating insights into customer repayment behavior.

8. **Grade-wise Revolving Balance:** The dashboard features a visual representation of the revolving balance categorized by loan grades, assisting in assessing risk exposure.

9. **Loans by States:** This visual allows users to explore the distribution of loans across different states, providing insights into regional lending patterns.

**Tools used:**
- Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Power BI Desktop: Utilized to create the interactive dashboard.
- GitHub: Employed for version control and project sharing.

**Aim of the project:**
1. To present a comprehensive and visually engaging dashboard that enables stakeholders to gain insights into the bank's loan portfolio.
2. To facilitate the exploration and understanding of loan trends, repayment patterns, and customer behavior over time.
3. To highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the bank's lending activities and financial health.
4. To provide an accessible and user-friendly tool for decision-makers to assess risk exposure, identify opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.
